Here are some design ideas for a system that determines user proficiency based on project contributions:

1. Dashboard Overview Design
Main Panel: A central dashboard that displays user proficiency across multiple skills in real-time.
Key Elements:
User Contribution Summary: Show a user’s overall proficiency, categorized by programming languages and tasks.
Skills Breakdown by Language: Use a pie chart or bar graph to visually display the proportion of each programming language a user has contributed to (similar to GitHub’s language breakdown).
Pull Request Metrics: Display stats for created, merged, and rejected pull requests, with a color-coded success/failure indicator.
Task Complexity Chart: Show task complexity ratings (e.g., simple, medium, complex) to illustrate the difficulty level of tasks the user has completed.
Design Tips:

Use icons for different actions (e.g., pull requests, merges, rejections) to make the interface intuitive.
Color-code user metrics: Red for rejected PRs, green for merged, blue for reviews, etc.
2. User Profile View
User’s Contribution Scorecard:
Profile Section: Display user avatar, name, and total contribution score prominently.
Language Proficiency Bars: Horizontal bars next to each language (e.g., Python, Java) showing proficiency level based on the frequency of code pushes.
PR Statistics: Cards that display stats like "Total Pull Requests Created," "Merged PRs," and "Rejected PRs" with bold and readable numbers.
Commit Activity Graph: A heatmap or line chart showing the number of commits over time for each language or task category.
Design Tips:

Add hover effects to the bars or charts, giving more detailed information when users hover over them (e.g., the number of pull requests merged in a specific repository).
Use badges (e.g., "Top Reviewer" or "Feature Expert") based on user achievements in specific areas.
3. Skill Radar Chart
Radar Chart for Skill Visualization:
Use a radar/spider chart to show a user’s proficiency across multiple dimensions like languages, tasks, and code reviews.
The axes represent categories (e.g., Java, Python, Code Reviews, Bug Fixes), and the filled area shows their proficiency level.
Design Tips:

Interactive Data Points: Clicking on each axis or skill area should provide a breakdown of how the score was calculated (e.g., a list of top pull requests for Java).
Dynamic Updates: The chart should update dynamically as users push more code, create new PRs, or resolve more issues.
4. Task Complexity Progress Bar
Progress Bar for Task Completion:
Show user proficiency in terms of task complexity with a progress bar. The bar could have sections for "Simple," "Medium," and "Complex" tasks.
Visualize how well a user handles more difficult tasks (e.g., the "Complex" section of the bar could be highlighted if they often complete challenging tasks).
Design Tips:

Each task complexity level should have a tooltip or detailed pop-up showing examples of tasks from that category.
Use animations for the progress bar to make updates feel more responsive and engaging.
5. Team or Project Comparison View
Side-by-Side Comparison:
Show a comparison chart where different team members’ skills are compared across key dimensions like coding language, PRs merged, or tasks completed.
Use a bar chart or line graph to compare individual users’ contribution metrics within a team.
Design Tips:

Allow filtering by time periods (e.g., last 3 months, last year) to see how contributions have evolved.
Add a feature for highlighting standout contributors based on specific contributions (e.g., someone who consistently handles complex PRs).
6. Gamification Elements
User Badges & Achievements:
Gamify the proficiency system by awarding badges and levels based on performance. For example, a user who successfully merges 50 pull requests could earn a "Merge Master" badge.
Create a leaderboard showing top contributors in different skill areas (e.g., "Top Python Developer").
Design Tips:

Design unique, visually appealing badges for different achievements and make them prominent on user profiles.
Integrate a level system where users "level up" based on accumulated contribution points across tasks and skills.
7. Contributions Timeline
Interactive Timeline:
Build an interactive timeline that shows milestones in the user’s contribution history (e.g., first merged PR, significant bug fixes, or completing complex tasks).
Users can scroll through the timeline to see how their proficiency has developed over time.
Design Tips:

Use milestone markers on the timeline with icons representing different types of contributions.
Provide clickable events that show more details about the contribution (e.g., "Merged PR #1024 – Refactored authentication module").
8. Dynamic Insights and Reports
Automated Insights Generation:
Automatically generate insights and reports for managers or users, summarizing key areas of proficiency and areas for improvement.
Use AI-driven analysis to suggest skill gaps or recommend areas where the user could improve based on their recent activity.
Design Tips:

Allow users or managers to receive regular email reports or push notifications with updated proficiency metrics.
Design the report as a PDF export option, including visual elements (charts, graphs) to easily convey the user's proficiency.
